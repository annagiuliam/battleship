# Battleship Game #

This project belongs to the curriculum of The Odin Project.

The game was developed using React.
The main goal of this project was to learn unit testing using Jest.

In this game, the user plays against the computer. 
To start the game, the user chooses a square on the computer board.
After the user has made the move, the computer will make its move.
The computer checks the available tiles and when a ship is hit it tries to hit all other adjacent tiles to sink the ship.
